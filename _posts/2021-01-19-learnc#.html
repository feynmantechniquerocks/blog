<p>I’ve decided to learn C# in 2021. I believe there are numerous reasons to learn C# and here are my reasons. </p>
<br>

<h1 class="title is-3">1. C# is versatile </h1>

<p>C# can be used to create numerous different applications.</p>
<br>
<p>You could use it to create desktop applications, web apps (both in backend and frontend), cloud applications, games development and mobile applications. </p>
<br>
<p>I know Python programming. Python is also a versatile language. I thought it’d be nice to add C# to my tools as well. (2 Swiss knives !)</p>

<br>

<h1 class="title is-3">2. Game Development</h1>
<p>I’ve watched a couple of documentaries about game development and I think game development requires huge amount of engineering skills. </p>
<br>
<p>Many people - especially adults who don’t know about games - think that games are waste of time but I think it’s a great area to apply engineering skills. I’ve been a gamer as long as I’ve known myself.</p>
<br>
<p>I think learning C# and developing a basic 3D games would be so much fun. </p>
<br>

<h1 class="title is-3">3. Huge Community Support and Number of Existing Libraries</h1>
<p>C# has been around for more than 20 years. It’s built its community along the way and it’s been doing it since then. </p>
<br>
<p>There are great books and video lessons for any C# subjects.</p>
<br>
<p>As a beginner, I believe I would be able to learn all the answers for my beginner questions. There are many useful answers on Stack Overflow and many great blog posts for your possible questions. (I hope this blog would be one of them.)</p>
<br>
<p>Another good thing about C# is that the people working with it. They’ve created lots of great tools and libraries for others to use. You can get your project ready by getting many libraries together. It’s convenient and mind-blowing !</p>
