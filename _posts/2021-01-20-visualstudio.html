<p>You need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write programs. An IDE consists of some tools that would help you as you write your own program.
</p>
<br>

<p> Before writing our first <b>“Hello World”</b> program, we will download and install an <b>IDE</b>.
</p>
<br>

<p>When it comes to C#, <b>Visual Studio</b> is the best choice. 
</p>
<br>

<p>In this post, I’m going to talk about how to download and install <b>Visual Studio</b>. I’d also mention the differences between different editions.
</p>
<br>

<h1 class="title is-3">1. Visual Studio Editions </h1>


<p>
    There are 3 <b>Visual Studio</b> Editions. 
    <div class="content">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Community</b>  </li>
            <li><b>Professional</b></li>
            <li><b>Enterprise</b></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</p>


<p>Editions are self explanatory and I don’t want to talk about them. If you want to compare the editions <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/tr/vs/compare/ " target="blank">please visit this page.</a> 
</p>
<br>

<p>The important edition for us (wanna be C# developers) is Community Edition. We are going to use it to learn C# and develop applications. <b>It’s completely free.</b> </p>
<br>

<h1 class="title is-3">2. How to Download Visual Studio Community Edition ?</h1>

<p>It’s so easy to download <b>Visual Studio</b> Community Edition. Just go ahead and <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/tr/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16" target="blank">click here</a>. This link will automatically download the vs_community.exe file which is the <b>Visual Studio Installer</b> software.</p>
<br>

<p>If you want to visit the download page of the <b>Visual Studio</b>. <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/tr/vs/" target="blank">Visit this page.</a> 
</p>
<br>

<h1 class="title is-3">3. How to Install Visual Studio Community Edition ?</h1>

<p>Start the <b>Visual Studio Installer</b> (The exe file you’ve just downloaded). Follow the instructions and it will take you to a page that looks like below. 
</p>
<br>

<div class="box">
    <figure class="image is-text-centered">
        <img src="../assets/images/visual-studio-installer.png" width="850" height="315">
        <figcaption><small>Visual Studio Installer </small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<br>

<p>You need to select the tools you’d need while developing applications. This could seem scary for the beginners but you really don’t have to worry about choices here. All you have to do is to select <b>.NET desktop development</b>. If you need other tools, you can always run <b>Visual Studio Installer</b> then you can download and install the tool you’d need.
</p>
<br>

<p>Most recent version of Community Edition is 2019 but <b>Visual Studio Installer</b> allows you to download and install 2017 version as well. 
</p>
<br>

<p>I suggest you to go with version 2019 but of course it’s up to you.
</p>
<br>

<p>We have our IDE installed. It is up and ready. Let's start programming.</p>
