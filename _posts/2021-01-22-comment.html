<p>This is going to be a short post.
</p>
<br>

<p><a href="https://feynmantechnique.rocks/hello-world-in-csharp/">In the last post</a>, we've written our <strong>Hello World</strong> program. This program is simple and basically does nothing. 
    We are going to write more complex programs in the future. We need to leave some reminders for us and for other people who might read the source code later on.
</p>
<br>

<p>These reminders are called comments in the programming world. Comments are too important and we need to learn how to use them effeciently.</p>
<br>

<p>There are three ways to make comments in C#.     
</p>
<br>

<p>The first one is <b>two slashes: //</b></p>
<br>

 {% highlight c# %}

 // This is the first comment.
 // You can make as many comments as you'd like
 // You can make multiline comments as well.
 Console.WriteLine("Comments are so fun !!!"); // Comments also can be here.

 {% endhighlight %}

<p>The second one is <b>the slash and the asterisk: /* */</b></p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

/* This is the first comment.
You can make as many comments as you'd like
You can make multiline comments as well. */

Console.WriteLine("Comments are so fun !!!"); /* Comments also can be here. */

{% endhighlight %}

<p>The third one is called <b>XML Documentation Comments</b>. We'll learn about this one when we talk about methods. For now, let's skip it.</p>
