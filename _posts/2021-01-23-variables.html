<p>In Math, a variable is an unknown number in an equation. In programming, a variable is a place in computer memory that holds the information regarding our programs.
</p>
<br>

<p>Variables are important in programming because they let us store the information and refer back to it when necessary.
</p>
<br>

<p>Every variable has a name and a type. Variable type shows what kind of data can be stored in it. Variable types are a huge deal in C#. It's a type-safe language.
</p>
<br>

<h1 class="title is-3">How to Defines Variable in C#</h1>

<p>Defining a variable is very simple and straightforward in C#. All you have to do is to give your variable a name and define its type.</p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

int temperature;

{% endhighlight %}

<p>The one-line code above defines a variable named temperature and its type is an integer. We'll get to data types later.</p>
<br>

<h1 class="title is-3">Assigning Values to Variables in C#</h1>

<p>Assigning values to variables in C# is also very simple and straightforward. Just use an equal operator ("=") and the value. </p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

temperature = 42; // If the variable is declared, no need to write its type.

int humidity = 58; // Variable declaration and assigning can be done in the same line.

{% endhighlight %}

<h1 class="title is-3">Getting the Values of Variables in C#</h1>

<p>If we need to get the value of a variable, we can just call the name of it to use its value. Let's see the complete code.</p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Hello_World
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // This is the first variable.
            int temperature;

            // Let's assign a value to our variable.
            temperature = 42;

            // Here is another variable, declared and assigned in the same line.
            int humidity = 58;

            // Let's get the value of the variables and write them on the console.
            Console.WriteLine(temperature);
            Console.WriteLine(humidity);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}

<h1 class="title is-3">How to Name Variables Properly</h1>

<p>To name variables properly:
    <div class="content">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Follow the rules:</b> According to C# docs, a variable name have to start with a letter or underscore (_). C#'s keywords can not be used as variable names. If you don't follow these rules, the compiler will raise errors.</li>
            <li><b>Choose descriptive names:</b> A good name should describe its content. If you are going to store the temperature of the kitchen, name it <b>temperature</b> or <b>kitchenTemperature</b>. Do not call it kittemp.</li>
            <li><b>Avoid using abbreviation:</b> If you use an abbreviation that is known to all people, it's OK to use it. Such as HTML, JS, etc. Otherwise, stop using abbreviations. Don't call it ktchtmp. A good rule of thumb is that if you're the only one who uses this abbreviation, avoid using it.</li>
            <li><b>Try to use language standards:</b> This is optional but I think it's important as well. If you're using C# try to use camelCase. If you're using Python try to use snake_case etc. Check out your language's community to see which one used frequently.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
