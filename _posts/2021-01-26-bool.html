<p>We have covered number related data types in the last two posts. Now it's time to talk about non-number types. Let's start with boolean data type and keep it short.</b>
</p>
<br>

<p>Bool data type is used to store boolean values which also known as <b>truth values.  </b>
</p>
<br>

<p>A bool keeps track of two states that means it only need 1-bit storage on the memory. Smallest memory unit that can be addressed is byte so a bool occupies a whole byte.</p>
<br>


{% highlight c# %}

//Let's create a boolean variables.
bool isTheButtonPressed = true;
bool isTheWindowOpened = false;

//Let's print the boolean variables on the console.
Console.WriteLine("isTheButtonPressed: {0}", isTheButtonPressed);
Console.WriteLine("isTheWindowOpened: {0}", isTheWindowOpened);

{% endhighlight %}

<p>And output will be:</p>

{% highlight c %}

isTheButtonPressed: True
isTheWindowOpened: False

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Bool types are very important in the programming. We use them heavily especially during the decision making process.</p>
