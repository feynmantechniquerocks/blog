<p>Our program might need information submitted from the user. We use ReadLine() method to get user input from the console.</b>
</p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

string userInput = Console.ReadLine();

{% endhighlight %}

<p>As you can see above, we store the user input in a string variable. That's right. The data type of the user input is always string. If we need user to input a number, we have to get the input as a string first then convert it to appropriate type.</p>
<br>

<p>Let's modify the triangle-area-calculation program we've written in the previous post. But this time get the base and height data from the user. Remember, The formula for calculation the area of a triangle is A = (1/2)*b*h where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height of it. </p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

// Get the base length of the triangle from user.
Console.WriteLine("Please input the b data of the triangle.");
string bAsString = Console.ReadLine();
double b = Convert.ToDouble(bAsString);

// Get the height of the triangle from user.
Console.WriteLine("Please input the h data of the triangle.");
string hAsString = Console.ReadLine();
double h = Convert.ToDouble(hAsString);

// Do the calculations
double area = (b * h) / 2;

//Print the result on the console using string concatenation
Console.WriteLine("Area of the given triangle is: " + area);

{% endhighlight %}


<p>Getting user input is very straightforward process in C#. All we need to remember is that we would convert the user input to the appropriate data type first using the Convert class.</p>
