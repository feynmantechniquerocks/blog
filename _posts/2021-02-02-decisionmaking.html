<p>Every program needs to make decisions at some point. These decisions are made based on the condition of a variable.</b>
</p>
<br>

<h1 class="title is-3">If/Else/Else if Statement</h1>

<p>We often use <b>if</b> statement (and some other form of it.) to make a decision in C#. Let's write a program that asks for the user's age. If the user is 18 or older, the user will be eligible to get a driving licence.</b>
</p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

Console.WriteLine("Please enter your age: ");
string ageAsString = Console.ReadLine();
int age = Convert.ToInt32(ageAsString);

if (age >= 18)
{
    //This code block will be executed if the condition is true.
    Console.WriteLine("You are eligible to have a driving licence.");
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>As you can see above, it's very easy to make a decision in C# using if statement. After if statement we have a parantheses that holds the condition variable.
    If the condition evaluates true then the compiler will execute the code in curly braces, if it evaluates false it will skip the code block in curly braces and move on.
</p>
<br>

<p>Let's update the code above add the else and else if.</p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

Console.WriteLine("Please enter your age: ");
string ageAsString = Console.ReadLine();
int age = Convert.ToInt32(ageAsString);

if (age >= 18)
{
    //This code block will be executed if the condition is true.
    Console.WriteLine("You are eligible to have a driving licence.");
}
else if ( age < 18){
    //This code block will be executed if the condition is true
    Console.WriteLine("Sorry! You can't have a driving licence.");
}
else {
    //This code block will be executed if none of the above is true
    Console.WriteLine("Are you sure you've entered a valid number ?");

{% endhighlight %}


<p>We don't know whether the condition will be true or false. We can make decisions for both options using else and elseif.</p>
<br>

<article class="message is-info">
    <div class="message-body">
        If there is only one statement, there is no need to use curly braces.
{% highlight c# %}

if (age >= 18)
    Console.WriteLine("You are eligible to have a driving licence.");
else 
    Console.WriteLine("Sorry! You can't have a driving licence.");
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>
</article>

<h1 class="title is-3">Relational Operators</h1>

<p>Most of the time we make comparions to have a conditional variables. We use relational operators to compare two operands. 
There are 6 relational operators.
<div class="content">
    <ul>
        <li> <b>==</b>: Checks if the two operands are equal.</li>
        <li> <b>!=</b>: Checks if the two operands are not equal.</li>
        <li> <b><</b>: Checks if the two left side operand is smaller than the right side operand.</li>
        <li> <b>></b>: Checks if the two left side operand is greater than the right side operand.</li>
        <li> <b><=</b>: Checks if the two left side operand is smaller than or equal to the right side operand.</li>
        <li> <b>>=</b>: Checks if the two left side operand is greater than or equal to the right side operand.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</p>
<br>

<h1 class="title is-3">Bools in Decision Making</h1>

<p>It's very common to use bools in decision making. This is valid for all programming languages. Here is an example.</p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

int speedLimit = 120;
Console.WriteLine("What is your speed ?");
int yourSpeed = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

bool isAllowed = yourSpeed <= speedLimit;

if (isAllowed)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Your speed is allowed on this road.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Your too fast. Slowdown !");
}
{% endhighlight %}

<article class="message is-info">
    <div class="message-body">
        As you can see above, relational operators return a bool value so they can be used in a way I used above. 
    </div>
</article>

<p>It's also possible to logical opposite of a bool in decision making. Using <b>! operator.</b> </p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

int ageLimit = 21;
Console.WriteLine("What is your age ?");
int yourAge = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

bool isAllowed = (yourAge >= ageLimit);

if (!isAllowed)
{
    Console.Write("You can't enter the bar.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("What do you want to drink ?");
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h1 class="title is-3">Logical Operators (AND and OR)</h1>

<p>These are the logical equivalent of AND and OR operators.
    <div class="content">
        <ul>
            <li> <b>AND Operator:</b> If the all operands are True, the condition will be True.  </li>
            <li> <b>OR Operator:</b> If any of the operands is True, the condition will be True.  </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

// AND Operator.
int age = 25;
int salary = 5000;

if (age >= 20 && salary > 2000)
{
    // Both are true so this block will be executed.
    Console.WriteLine("You're welcome to the club");
}

// OR Operator.
int year = 4;
int km = 120000;

if (year > 3 || km > 150000)
{
    // Only one of them is True but it's enough to execute this block.
    Console.WriteLine("We need to replace your car.");
}

{% endhighlight %}

<h1 class="title is-3">Ternary Operator</h1>

<p>Ternary operators work on three operands unlike unary operators or binary operators. Ternary operator is also called the conditional operator and it works like if-else statement.</p>
<br>

<p>The way of using ternary operator is like: </p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

(condition as bool) ? Value(if true) : Value (if false)

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Here is an example:</p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

int grade = 70;
Console.WriteLine((grade>65) ? "You passed!" : "You failed!");

{% endhighlight %}

<p>The output will be:</p>
<br>

{% highlight c %}

You passed!

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Ternary operator is a one-liner so it's nice to know it but for me it reduces the readability so I wouldn't use it for most cases.</p>
<br>

<h1 class="title is-3">Switch Statement</h1>

<p>The last statement in decision making I'd like to talk about is <b>Switch Statement</b>. Switch statement and If statement can be used interchangeably for most cases.
Sometimes using one of them instead of the other can be more readable. </p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

int carChoice = 2;

switch (carChoice)
{
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine("BMW");
        break;
    case 2:
        Console.WriteLine("Mercedes");
        break;
    case 3:
        Console.WriteLine("Audio");
        break;
    case 4:
        Console.WriteLine("WW");
        break;
    case 5:
        Console.WriteLine("Opel");
        break;
    case 6:
        Console.WriteLine("Fiat");
        break;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>The output will be: </p>

{% highlight c# %}

Mercedes 

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Switch statement doesn't allow logical operators as case condition. If this is the case, we could only use if statement not switch.</p>
<br>

<article class="message is-info">
    <div class="message-body">
        <b>break</b> should be used for every case unlike C++ and Java. Otherwise the compiler will raise an error. 
    </div>
