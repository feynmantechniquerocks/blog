<p>Programming is all about solving problems. In real life, one of the best way to solve a big problem is to break it down into smaller pieces. This method also applies programming problems.</b>
    C# provides us methods to do so. Methods are also known as functions, subroutines and procedures in other programming languages.
</p>
<br>

<p>Methods are one of the core parts of C#. In fact, we have been using them since the beginning. We always print some text on the console, right ? 
    WriteLine is the name of the method and it belongs to Console class. We will talk about classes in the next posts.
</p>
<br>


<h1 class="title is-3">Creating and Calling Methods</h1>

<p>Let's create a method.</b>
</p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

static void sayHello()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Greetings !");
}

{% endhighlight %}


<p>That's it. We've just created our first method. It just prints <b>Greetings !</b> on the console. There are a few things to address at the moment.
    <div class="content">
        <ul>
            <li><b>1. Static:</b> Let's skip this for now.</li>
            <li><b>2. Void:</b> That means our method will not return anything. I will show you how to return something in a minute. </li>
            <li><b>3. Method Name:</b> We have to name our method so we can call them later. Our method name is sayHello.</li>
            <li><b>4. Paranthesis:</b> Parenthesis are for arguments. sayHello doesn't require any arguments.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</p>

<p>We have our sayHello method but we haven't called it yet. In order to make our method work, we need to call it in our main program.
</p>

{% highlight c# %}

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Methods
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

            sayHello();
        }

        static void sayHello()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Greetings !");
        }
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}


<h1 class="title is-3">Return Something from a Method</h1>

<p>We usually need methods to make some sort of calculations for us so we need methods to return something.</p>
<br>

<p>Here is an example:</p>
<br>

{% highlight c# %}

namespace Method
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

            int myRandomNumber = randomIntGenerator();
            Console.WriteLine($"My random number is: {myRandomNumber}.");
        }

        static int randomIntGenerator()
        {
            return 71;
        }
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Here you can see, we changed void with int. That tells the compiler our method will return an integer. We can assign the return value to a variable and then use it.</p>
<br>

<h1 class="title is-3">Method Arguments</h1>

<p>Methods are supposed to be reusable so we need them to be used over and over again within different situations. That's why we need to give them arguments and return a value depends on the arguments provided.</p>
<br>

<p>We had a small program in the past to calculate the area of the given triangle. Let's write a method that calculates the area of a triangle. We will need the base and the height as the arguments.</p>

{% highlight c# %}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {

        float area = areaCalculator(17.2f, 5.6f);
        Console.WriteLine($"Area of the given triangle is: {area}.");
        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    static float areaCalculator(float baseValue, float height)
    {
        float area = (baseValue * height) / 2;
        return area;
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>The output will be: </b>
</p>
<br>

{% highlight c %}

Area of the given triangle is: 48.16.
