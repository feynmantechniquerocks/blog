<p><span >Do you know the guy in the picture ?&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span >He is Richard Feynman. He&rsquo;s the world-known, nobel-prize-winning physicist.According to Physics World magazine, <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200002/top10.cfm" target="blank"><b> is one of the ten greatest physicist of all time.</b></a></span></p>
<br>
<p><span >But most importantly, he&rsquo;s the name father of this blog. (Like he would have cared :D)&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span >Why I named this blog after him ? Because he&rsquo;s a great explanier. He&rsquo;s not only a legend physicist but also a great teacher. He was able to teach all the complex ideas in simple words.</span></p>

<p><span >When I was browsing through the learning methods, I came across with the Feynman Technique. I read about the technique and I really loved it and decided to apply it to topics I&rsquo;d like to learn.</span><span >This&rsquo;s the reason why I started this blog.&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span ><b>To apply Feynman Technique, there are 4 steps.&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<div class="content">
    <ol>
    <li  ><span >Choose a topic that you&rsquo;d like to learn and study it.</span></li>
    <li  ><span >Teach the things you learn to someone or pretend that you&rsquo;re teaching it.</span></li>
    <li  ><span >See the gaps in your explaination and go back and study about them more.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li  ><span >Once you think you understand the topic very well, review your understanding and simplify it.&nbsp;</span></li>
    </ol>

<p><span >That's it. Feynman Technique is a simple yet an effective learning method that I'm going to use. I'll try to share simplified version of my understanding of various topics.</span></p>
