<p>This blog was built with Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. That means there is no backend.</p>
<br>
<p>There are some solutions to add forms to static Jekyll blog such as formspree but I don't want to deal with them at the moment.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe I can set up a newsletter or a Discord server in the future but not for now.</p>
<br>
